            <h2>Why Challock?</h2>
            <h3>A beautiful village in the Kent Downs</h3>
            <p>
              Challock is a mostly wooded, large village and civil parish in the
              Borough of Ashford, Kent, England. The village name derives from
              the old English 'Cealfloca' - calf enclosure. A clear nucleus of
              the village is centred 8 miles south of the port of Faversham and
              5 miles north of Ashford. It dates from around AD823.

              William the Conqueror gave the manor of Challock to Battle Abbey,
              and it remained in the Abbey's possession until the dissolution of
              the monasteries by Henry VIII in the 16th century.[3] A smock mill
              stood to the north of the village until 1906 when it was destroyed
              by a storm - the mill had not been working for many years prior to
              this event.[4] The parish church is dedicated to Saints Cosmas and
              Damian; it has fine wall paintings by celebrated local artist John
              Ward and his friend Gordon Davies. There is also a Methodist
              chapel in the village. A Goose Fair is held in September each
              year.
